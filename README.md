Exchange (TS)
something like backpack.exchange or binance

so you have a crypto exchange not something like nse or a stock exchange

we are going to build a cex in ts and rust Centralised Exchange

Read system design from book Once architecture, design done, start writing apis, their request response, document them Then slowly start shaping them

Super30 1st project: backpack like exchange in ts and rust; work on system design, db, architecture, what you using, and why; document till exams, then start coding it

Uhh document code with help of jsdocs Go easy on ui part, don't fuck this up like muskan

docs on api api-client

how binance works: buyer puts some price, seller puts some price broker/exchange talks to both both bid money, then if it is working out, then transaction happen

orderbook: list of order, sell at x, buy at y

so web2 works, but web3 is not liquid cause gas fee

so on blockchain what happens

say eth at 2000$, so when the demand(selling) goes up, price decreases; buying(supply) goes down, price increase

liquidity pools; automated market maker

market maker are people who place order on book

liquidity pool now say a person has 10 houses, 20cr 1st house: 1cr(sell) 2nd: 1.1cr(sell) 3rd: 1.2cr(sell)

order on other hand: 1st house:70l(buy) 2nd house:65l(buy)

he is a market maker

now he puts all assets(buy+sell) on a pool so price of single house is? so we will use constant product market maker x\*y=constant x: quantity of 1 asset y: quantity of 2nd asset

k changes when funds are provided or withdrawn

10\*20=200

took 1 house

so pool changes after that: 9 houses; so y\*9=200 y=22.22

so to buy 1 house now: 2.22 cr

so again then 8\*x=200 like that buying increases price also increases

bulding a dex more liquidity, the better price client gets

amm handles this in single pool

constant product market maker, so x\*y=constant

create a server; 4 operation:

/add-liquidity
/buy-asset
/sell-asset
/quote
so buying increase price, then people sell since they get profit, so price goes down

Centralized Exchange (CEX
An exchange like Binance in which you don’t own your the underlying asset (ETH/SOL/BTC).

Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
ex: drift

A place where people can come and swap assets (ETH for USDC or vice versa) and the assets are debited from/ credited to their cold storage.

There is no central authority that holds the crypto ever

CEXs and DEXs are two ways to exchange assets.
P2P is another way (Barter system) to do the same.
DEX became a popular way to exchange assets when people wanted to keep the custody of their assets with themselves.
In the next slide onwards, we’ll understand how to create tokens on ETH. This is a pre-requisite before we can understand how we can build an exchange that lets users swap these tokens
so ui has like columns:

stock name bid orders qty offer oders qty

price of stock: price at which last order took place

limit order

putting a (price, qty) tuble on the orderbook
usually used by Traders
Has some trading fee associated with every order that matches
market order

Buying a qty off the orderbook
usually used by retail
usually preceded by a getQuoteReq
usually higher fee than limit order
liquidity/market depth

How many orders (price/ qty) does the book have
Can it handle big ordors w/o crashing the price
More liquidity= Better exchange
Market maker provide liquidity.
Maker v/s Taker
person whose order exist on book: maker
person who gets their order filled: taker
tkaer fee>maker fee b/c they take away liquidity from book.
where does latency matter
→ Exchange

Order blacement time
Time to fetch the orderbook
Realtime updates on the orderbook
→ Trader

Order ace time
Ordor cancel time
Their Order priority.
latency in exchange
fast languages
faster serialisation/deserialisation of data
in memory databases
how latency is made better
being closer to server
multiple connections to server
faster serialisation/deserialisation
faster oracles/prediction models
exchange orderbook
user can : - place Limit orders - If an order can be executed(partially a completely) it is filled - Users can query the depth chart - User can get back thin balance

Routes
/order, POST
{
userId:str,
side:buy/sell,
price:number,
qty:number
ticker:google/usdc
}
/balance, request: GET
{
userId
}
response:

{
usdBalance,
googleBalance
}
/depth returns bids and asks
stack: ts, ws, redis, kafka, postgres
